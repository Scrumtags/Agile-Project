```
git clone https://github.com/jyleoxcino/ACIT-2911-Group-22.git
```

2. Download Python 3.11.X

3. OPTIONAL - Create Virtual Environment

_this step isn't super important but term 1 students will eventually learn to do it in term2. also it's good practice to have your development environments in virtual environments in case of something messes up_

Install Venv - Virtual Environment
```
pip install venv
```

Create Virtual Environment for managing Python Modules (Good Practice when developing)

```
python -m venv studybuddydevelopment
```
_This will take some time to create a virtual environment in the directory you're in._

Activate Virtual Environment
_you must be in a parent directory with the studybuddydevelopment child folder_ 

```
./studybuddydevelopment/scripts/activate.ps1
```

3. Install Libraries

```
pip install pyqt5 pyqt5-tools
```
